# AnychainDB API

## Getting started with AnychainDB APIs

Welcome to the AnychainDB API reference! 

AnychainDB is distributed, high-loaded, blockchain database.

The AnychainDB API is based on REST. 
This documentation lists and describes the resources you can used to manipulate objects on the AnychainDB Blockchain. 

## Authentication

AnychainDB API uses [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) method, 
that requires to obtain public/private keys for account identification.
First you create account with Accounts resource.
After you can get access to post new data (payload) to AnychainDB.

## Server Responses

+ 200 OK - The request was successful.
+ 202 Accepted - The request's data was successfully posted to the blockchain queue.
+ 400 Bad Request - The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters (check msg field in response for details).
+ 401 Unauthorized - Authentication failed or user does not have permissions for the requested operation (check msg field in response for details).
+ 404 Not Found - Resource was not found.
+ 405 Method Not Allowed - Requested method is not supported for the specified resource.
+ 429 Too Many Requests - Exceeded AnychainDB API limits.

## Accounts [/v1/accounts]

This resource is intended for create accounts.
Every users have their unique accounts in the system.

### Create a new account [POST]

+ Request (application/json)
    
+ Response 202 (application/json)
    + Attributes
        + code: 202 (number)
        + msg: Accepted (string)
        + data (Account)

## Payloads [/v1/payloads{?limit}{?offset}]

This resource is intended for listing, sending and view details about transaction data (payload).

Payload contains from two main parts: private and public data. You can place any data to this fields.
*Private data* encrypted by ECDH algorithm with public key of receiver. For encryption of private data AnychainDB uses [Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman) protocol, that also uses ECDSA but for assymetric data encryption.
*Public data* keeps any open data without encryption.
ReceiverAccountID fields contains information about receiver's account, that decrypts private data with it private key.
